# BenAddon

BenAddon (XML, Lua) contains improvements to the default interface in World of Warcraft Classic. 

To install, download the .zip and place the included folder into your WorldOfWarcraft/_classic_/Interface/Addons folder.

Once logged into a character, type /benui into the chatbox and a GUI will appear controlling your preferences (saved for all characters).

By checking the "Raid frame toggle" box, everytime a member joins/leaves your group the down-arrow included in the default UI will be hidden.
By checking the "Whisper followed player" box, everytime the player follows or stops following they will whisper the target with their follow status.
